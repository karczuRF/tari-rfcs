## Goals

The aim of this Request for Comment (RFC) is to describe the process of tapplet installation in the Tari Universe.

- [RFC-1102: Tapplet Registry](https://github.com/tari-project/rfcs/pull/138)

## Description

Tablet installation process is important and crucial in two cases:

### 1. Adding to the Tapplets Registry

As it was described in the RFC-1102 Tapplet Registry, to add a new tapplet to the registry it needs to be verified first. To achieve that a given npm package with compressed tapplet is downloaded, extracted and checked if the provided checksum, data and files structure are valid. The process must be performed automatically, therefore GitHub Actions are needed to run the script responsible for a tapplet validation.

#### Verification Script

The script should be written in Rust to be consistent with the chosen projectâ€™s technical stack. In particular the script should:

- download the npm package using http (not npm install, because it is not desirable to install dependencies)
- extract compressed file
- check files structure and required files presence (like index.html or tapplet.manifest.json)
- given checksum equals to the calculated one from the installed package

### 2. Installing and running a tapplet in the Tari Universe

As it was described in the RFC-1100 Tari Universe is a marketplace, so its inherent feature is to download and run any registered tapplet. In this case the process should be similar to the one described above as the Verification Script. However some extra actions are required to successfully install and run a tapplet:

- defining the download folder path
- defining the cache folder path

Tauri provides well documented modules for working with file and directory paths. This package is simply called [path](https://tauri.app/v1/api/js/path).

#### Download directory path

Platform-specific download directory:

- Linux: Resolves to **_xdg-user-dirs'_** `XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR`.
- macOS: Resolves to `$HOME/Downloads`.
- Windows: Resolves to `{FOLDERID_Downloads}`.

To get the user's download directory path in Tauri, the `downloadDir` function can be used from the `path` module. Here's an example of how to use it:

```
import { downloadDir } from '@tauri-apps/api/path';

const downloadDirPath = await downloadDir();
```

#### Cache directory path

Tauri provides also a built-in API for managing the application cache, which allows to store and retrieve data in a secure and efficient manner. The API is based on the IndexedDB standard, which is a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files/blobs.

Platform-specific cache directory:

- Linux: Resolves to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` or `$HOME/.cache`.
- macOS: Resolves to `$HOME/Library/Caches`.
- Windows: Resolves to `{FOLDERID_LocalAppData}`.

To get the user's cache directory path in Tauri, the `cacheDir` function can be used from the `path` module. Here's an example of how to use it:

```
import { cacheDir } from '@tauri-apps/api/path';

const cacheDirPath = await cacheDir();
```


#### Tauri configuration 

Thanks to the [Tauri configuration object](https://tauri.app/v1/api/config/#file-formats) it is possible to customize the Tari Universe application and adjust directories paths. Therefore it is recommended to extract downloaded tapplet and keeps its data within separate folders.
